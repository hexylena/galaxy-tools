    <readme>GenomicConsensus (quiver)
-------------------------

The ``GenomicConsensus`` package provides the ``quiver`` tool, PacBio's
flagship consensus and variant caller. The backend logic is provided by
the ``ConsensusCore`` library, which you must install first.

Installing
----------

Make sure you have set up and activated your virtualenv, and installed
``pbcore`` and ``ConsensusCore`` (which cannot be installed
automatically by pip or setuptools). Then:

.. code:: sh

    % python setup.py install

Running
-------

Basic usage is as follows:

.. code:: sh

    % quiver aligned_reads.cmp.h5 -r reference.fasta -o variants.gff -o consensus.fasta -o consensus.fastq

in this example we perform haploid consensus and variant calling on the
mapped reads in the ``aligned_reads.cmp.h5`` which was aligned to
``reference.fasta``. The ``reference.fasta`` is only used for
designating variant calls, not for computing the consensus. The
consensus quality score for every position can be found in the output
FASTQ file.
